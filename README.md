## Step 1: Creating and launching the virtual environment

Open up your terminal. Then, execute the following command to create the Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv django-react
```

Then, execute the following command on Mac (remove .fish for a different shell):
```bash
source django-react/bin/activate.fish
```

or this command on Windows:

```bash
.\django-react\bin\activate
```

to enter the environment.

## Step 2: Installing Django

Run `pip3 install django` to install Django in the virtual environment, and then cd into the backend folder within the project. Once inside the backend folder, you can run `python3 manage.py runserver` to start the Django backend server.

## Step 3: Installing React

For macOS, install node.js and npm via homebrew using

```bash

```

mention running npm install and npm install --save form-data

run npm install react-router-dom
